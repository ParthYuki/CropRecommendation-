The above file contains the python code for a comparative analysis of different classification models on a dataset containing samples of crop including their nutrient values like N, P, K, Ph, Cu, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and other factors.
It provides the accuracies of different models when applied on a same dataset in a classification problem.
Further it contains an user interface which enables the user the nutrient values of their crops and get the name of the crop from the 6 crops on which the model is trained on.
